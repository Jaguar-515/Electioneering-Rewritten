# Electioneering Rewritten
## About
Electioneering Rewritten is an open source fork of the original Electioneering by ParadoInk, which ceased development and became open sourced.

This repository aims to be a "rewritten" version of the original Electioneering by refactoring the code to make it more viable for development on the bot, eventually implementing new features.

## Contributing
Any contributions are welcome as long as it helps the project, such as, but not limited to:
- Assisting with rewriting the codebase
- Adding new features
- Squashing bugs
- Documentation

### Hosting/Contributing Guide

Insert this into `config.json`:
