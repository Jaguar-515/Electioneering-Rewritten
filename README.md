# Electioneering Rewritten
## About
Electioneering Rewritten is an open source fork of the original Electioneering by ParadoInk, which ceased development and became open sourced.

This repository aims to be a "rewritten" version of the original Electioneering by refactoring the code to make it more viable for development on the bot, eventually implementing new features.
